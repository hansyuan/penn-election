from 86% reporting onward, observe candidate momentum with knowledge that most vote-in-person

This math model attempts to set a theshold for the required proportion of votes to go to
him in order for him to overtake the leading candidate. More explanations in 
[Explanations](./Explanations).

Sample with two graphs and code output from last 2 iterations.

These are of course not the best models, and the x-axis is not necessarily linear.
